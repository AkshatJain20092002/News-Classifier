# News-Classifier
### Project Description:
This project aims to build a supervised learning NLP model to classify fake news from true news using the "News Classifier Dataset." The dataset can be found at Kaggle.

### Preprocessing Steps:
Tokenization: The text data will be tokenized into individual words or tokens for further analysis.
Stopword Removal: Commonly occurring words (stopwords) that do not contribute much to the classification will be removed.
Porter Stemming: Words will be reduced to their base or root form using Porter stemming to reduce feature dimensionality.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): The text data will be converted into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF technique, which captures the importance of each word in the documents relative to the entire corpus.

### Models:
Logistic Regression Model
Passive Aggressive Classifier Model
